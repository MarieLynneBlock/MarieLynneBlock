### About me:     
I am a strong T-shaped AI Expert with a hidden multifaceted full-stack software engineer/data scientist persona, using my professional experience to experiment with computer music, sound AI/ML, generative art and animation.

<br/>

###### :sunny: by day
• AI Expert with an understanding of DevSecOps/MLOps principles, release management and experience in AI, ML, Big Data\
• Working on Solution Architecture to provide seamless integrations and flexible code solutions\
• Keeping an eye on the end product by providing product and project management support\
• Experience in international and multilingual environments, strong communication skills. (I enjoy discovering new languages; nice bonus: it improves travelling and reading experiences, two things I love doing!)\
• Agile: experience with Scrum, Lean, Kanban and XP aka: 🏃‍♂️ Sprint & Sync 🔄

<br> 

###### :first_quarter_moon_with_face: by night
• Creative jack-of-all-trades with a strong interest in multimedia\
• A musician & sound engineer\
• Likes photography and videography (especially mirrorless technology)\
• Enjoys working with pen and paper as much as experimenting with generative art\
• A mom of a toddler that tries to hijack the keyboard as soon as I start programming (succession of our future is guaranteed).

</br>

TL;DR:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on AI / ML microservices universe...
- 📊 ...and connect the dots of huge piles of data to help businesses understand their clients
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Neural Networks and AWS Deep Learning Algorithms
- 🚀 Taking courses in Product and Project Management, focusing on strengthening my Change Management skills
- 🐍 Professional Python enchanter and 🐼 Pandas trainer
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creative (audio-visual) and music/sound-AI projects

### Projects:

   🚧 but first this 🚧
</p>
Most of the code you stumble upon here is just me monkeying around... 🐒 <br>
My GitHub primarily reflects my experimentation with new technologies, hobby projects, and learning endeavors. Please view it as a glimpse into my exploration 🧪 rather than a testament to my professional abilities 🦸.
