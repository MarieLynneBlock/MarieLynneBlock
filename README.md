## Hey there!! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">
    
I am a strong T-shaped AI Expert with a hidden multifaceted full-stack software engineer/data scientist persona, using my professional experience to experiment with computer music, sound AI/ML, generative art and animation.

<br/>

:sunny: by day\
• AI Expert with an understanding of DevSecOps/MLOps principles, release management and experience in AI, ML, Big Data\
• Working on Solution Architecture to provide seamless integrations and flexible code solutions\
• Keeping an eye on the end product by providing product and project management support\
• Experience in international and multilingual environments, strong communication skills. (I enjoy discovering new languages; nice bonus: it improves travelling and reading experiences, two things I love doing!)\
• Agile: experience with Scrum, Lean, Kanban and XP aka: 🏃‍♂️ Sprint & Sync 🔄

:first_quarter_moon_with_face: by night\
• Creative jack-of-all-trades with a strong interest in multimedia\
• A musician & sound engineer\
• Likes photography and videography (especially mirrorless technology)\
• Enjoys working with pen and paper as much as experimenting with generative art

</br>

TL;DR:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on AI / ML microservices universe
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Neural Networks and AWS Deep Learning Algorithms
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creative (audio-visual) projects
